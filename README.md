**Numbas** is an open-source system for creating tests which run entirely in the browser. It has been developed by [Newcastle University's School of Mathematics, Statistics and Physics](http://www.ncl.ac.uk/maths-physics).

For more information about Numbas and what it does, see our website at [numbas.org.uk](http://www.numbas.org.uk).

### Documentation

Documentation is at [numbas-editor.readthedocs.org](http://numbas-editor.readthedocs.org).

### Installation

This repository contains the Numbas compiler, which runs as standalone Python 3, but the most convenient way to use Numbas is through the web-based editor. 

A publicly-available editor, requiring no set-up, is available at [numbas.mathcentre.ac.uk](http://numbas.mathcentre.ac.uk). Or, you can follow [our instructions for Windows, Mac, or Ubuntu to install your own instance](http://numbas.github.io/editor).

If you decide to run your own installation, install the compiler's dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

### Development

Numbas is open source, and we welcome contributions of any sort. Bug reports or feature suggestions can be added to [the GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/numbas/Numbas/issues), or emailed to numbas@ncl.ac.uk. 

See [our page on contributing to Numbas](http://www.numbas.org.uk/contributing-to-numbas/) for more information on how you can help.

We keep a list of tasks specifically for new contributors, under the [good-first-issue label](https://github.com/numbas/Numbas/labels/good%20first%20issue). There's [a corresponding list in the editor repository](https://github.com/numbas/editor/labels/good%20first%20issue), too. These tasks should be fairly straightforward to implement without much knowledge of how all the code fits together.

This repository is just one part of the Numbas ecosystem. See [the numbas organisation](http://github.com/numbas) for the other pieces, including the web-based editor, extensions, and VLE integrations.
