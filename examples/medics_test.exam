							*Scientific Notation and Exponential Numbers.*

							Exponential notation is an alternative method of expressing numbers. 	

							Exponential numbers take the form $a^n$, where $a$ is multiplied by itself $n$ times. A simple example is $8 = 2^3 = 2 \times 2 \times 2$.

							In exponential notation, $a$ is termed the _base_ while $n$ is termed the _power_ or _exponent_ or _index_.

							Scientific notation is a specific example of exponential numbers, $10$ is almost always used as the base number. Thus $10^3$ means $10 \times 10 \times 10 = 1000$, while $10^{-3}$ is the notation for the reciprocal of $10^3$ namely $\frac{1}{1000}$.

							The other name for this mathematical format is _standard form_ (you may have come across this in GCSE mathematics).

							Expressing numbers which are not whole powers of $10$ in scientific notation often requires a further multiplier, termed the _coefficient_ ($C$), giving the expression in the form $C \times 10^n$.

							For example, $5 \times 10^3$ is the scientific notation for the number $5000$, while $3.25 \times 10^2$ is the scientific notation for the number $325$.

							Similarly, $3.25 \times 10^{-2}$ would represent $3.25 \times \frac{1}{100} = 0.0325$.

							It is scientific convention to express all such numbers as coefficients between $1$ and $10$ followed by an appropriate power of $10$ (for example, as $3.25 \times 10^{-2}$, not as $0.325 \times 10^{-1}$, nor as $32.5 \times 10^{-3}$).

							You should use such scientific notation whenever you express very large or very small numbers - it is a recognized form of "shorthand", and it avoids spurious accuracy (e.g. writing $9$ $000$ $000$  suggests that the number is exactly $9$ million, in contrast to $9.0 \times 10^6$ which suggests no such accuracy beyond the first decimal place of the coefficient).

								Step 2. Now you take $V_3 = \var{w10}$ ml at the concentration $C_2$ you have just found and add it to $\var{w11}$ ml of sterile water to get a volume $V_4 = \var{w10} + \var{w11} = \var{w10 + w11}$ ml. If $C_4$ is the concentration of this volume you use $C_2V_3 = C_4V_4$ and so find $C_4$ mol/l which is the final concentration required.

								(ii) As in part (i) above, you split the problem into two steps. You get the same concentration at the end of Step 1. The only difference is that now $V_4 = \var{w12}$ but you use the same formula $C_2V_3 = C_4V_4$ to find $C_4$.

				For part (i) you take the ratio of the final volume to the initial volume to get the dilution factor.
				
				The initial volume is $\var{w1}$ ml.
				
				The final volume is $\var{w1} + \var{w3} = \var{w1 + w3}$ ml and so the dilution factor is $\frac{\var{w1 + w3}}{\var{w1}} = \var{(w1+w3)/w1}$.
