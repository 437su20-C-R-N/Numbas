			advice: """
				The equation of the line is of the form $y=mx+c$. 
				You are given the gradient $m= \simplify{{b-d}/{a-c}}$ and we can calculate the constant term $c$ by noting that $y=\var{b}$ when $x=\var{a}$. 
				Using this we get:
				\[
				\begin{eqnarray}
				\var{b}&=&\simplify[1111110111111111]{({f}){a}+c} \Rightarrow\\
				c&=&\simplify[1111110111111111]{{b}-{f}{a}={g}}
				\end{eqnarray}
				\]

Hence the equation of the line is  
				\[y = \simplify[1111110111111111]{{f}x+{g}}\]
