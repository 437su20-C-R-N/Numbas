There are currently two sets of documentation for Numbas - the PDF manual and the web docs.
The PDF manual is much more complete, but quite out of date. The web docs are nicely presented and have helpful interactive elements, but aren't yet complete.
We're working on covering everything in the web docs but for now, try the web docs first, and then manual.pdf if you can't find what you're looking for.

If you're still stuck, feel free to email <a href="mailto:numbas@ncl.ac.uk">numbas@ncl.ac.uk</a> with your question.
